## The DataAnimals

**Welcome to the Berlin Data Dive** 

In the next slides you will get to know us and learn something about the dataset we have compiled for you. For further questions, feel free to approach one of the present animals at any time during the event. 


## Who are we?

We are a group of Berlin-based Master's students with a strong background in data analysis and statistics. 

We are a nonprofit with no business interests. Our motivation is to further develop ourselves and our skills beyond textbooks and theories.

## What do we do after the dive?

- Workshops for R, Stata, and Excel
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualisation

## Dataset 1

The datasets are merges from four different sources (description of these sources in Hackpad). 

They include the 
- individual students names and grades of their school leaving examinations (2013 - 2014)
- information about their schools (2011 - 2014)
- Internal Jambo Bukoba data (2010 - 2015)

## Dataset 2

Three formats: (1) Student level, (2) School level, (3) Time Series

(2) and (3) being transformation of (1), (1) being most comprehensive.

Which one to use? Depends on your research ideas. Remember: you can easily transform the data yourself.

## Dataset 3

The (1) student levlel (most comprehensive) dataset we compiled contains **`r ncol(StudentLevel)`** variables and **`r nrow(StudentLevel)`** observation in total.

It is cross-sectional data, the unit being the student. Thus, there are **`r nrow(StudentLevel)`** in 2013 and 2014 in the data, who go to **`r nrow(SchoolLevel)`** different schools.

## Gender ratio
Proportion of male and female students, 2013 and 2014
```{r echo=FALSE}
MaleFemale <- table(StudentLevel$student_sex)
lbls <- c("Female", "Male")
pct <- round(MaleFemale/sum(MaleFemale)*100)
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct)
lbls <- paste(lbls, "%", sep="")
pie(MaleFemale, labels = lbls, col = rainbow(length(lbls)), main="Pie Chart of Gender")
```


## Gender ratio
Proportion of male and female students per class, 2013 and 2014 (0%-82%). 
```{r echo=FALSE}
hist(TimeSeries$Student_sex_mean, main="Percentage of male student")
```

## Workshops
Teachers from how many different schools have participated in workshops?
```{r echo=FALSE}
tab <- table(SchoolLevel$SUM.WORKSHOPS)
tab
```

## Pie charts schools reached overall
In total 31% have at least one teacher who visited a workshop. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
SchoolsWS <- table(SchoolLevel$SUM.WORKSHOPS)
#pie(SchoolsWS)
lbls4 <- paste(names(SchoolsWS), "\n", SchoolsWS, sep="")
pct4 <- round(SchoolsWS/sum(SchoolsWS)*100, 1)
lbls4 <- paste(pct4,"%",sep="") # ad % to labels
pie(SchoolsWS, labels = lbls4, col=rainbow(length(lbls4)),
    main="Sum of Workshops - School Level\n (percentage)") 
legend("topright", c("No Workshop","One Workshop","Two Workshops","Three Workshops"), cex=0.55, fill=rainbow(length(lbls4)))
```

## Average grade of schools, distribution in 2014
```{r echo=FALSE}
hist(SchoolLevel$Average_Marks_2013, main="Average grade 2014")
```

## Student's grade distribution Englisch, 2013 and 2014
```{r echo=FALSE}
hist(StudentLevel$english_grade_numeric, main="Grades Englisch")
```

## Warm-up questions
Do you want to familiarize yourself with datasets? Here are simple warm up tasks for you:

1. How many schoolprojects are in the dataset? What were the activities?
2. How many schools have more female than male students?
3. How many students did participate in workshops in 2014?
4. Are grades normally distributed?
5. Are boys better in math and girls better in languages?
