## The DataAnimals

**Welcome to the Berlin Data Dive** 

In the next slides you will get to know us and learn something about the dataset we have compiled for you. For further questions, feel free to approach one of the present animals at any time during the event. 

## Dataset 

The datasets are merged from four different sources (description of these sources in Hackpad). 

They include the 
- Individual student's names and grades of their school leaving examinations (2013 - 2014)
- Information about their schools (2011 - 2014)
- Internal Jambo Bukoba data (2010 - 2015)

## Dataset 

Three formats: (1) Student level, (2) School level, (3) Time Series

With (2) and (3) being transformations of (1).

With (1) being most comprehensive.

Which one to use? Depends on your research ideas. Remember: you can easily transform the data yourself.

## Dataset format 1 - Student level

The (1) student levlel (most comprehensive) dataset we compiled contains **`r ncol(StudentLevel)`** variables and **`r nrow(StudentLevel)`** observation in total.

It is cross-sectional data, the unit being the student. Thus, there are **`r nrow(StudentLevel)`** students who passed their school leaving examinations in 2013 and 2014 in the data, who visited **`r nrow(SchoolLevel)`** different schools.

## Dataset format 2 - School level

A reduced version of the student level data. 

Individual student data is dropped.

Each school in one row, Jambo Bukoba's data is bound right.

## Dataset format 3 - Time series

School level data as time series.

Each school has one row pear year (2010 to 2015).

School data and Jambo Bukoba is bound right.



## Main questions
- Does a student whose teacher visited a workshop have better grades than a student that did not?

- Does a student who participated in a Bonanza AND whose teacher visited a workshops have better grades than other students? What about school projects? Does it depend on the kind of project?

- Does the effect differ between boys and girls?

## Main questions 
- If there is an effect, when does it kick in? How long does it hold? Does it change, weaken, reverse...?

- Are there any identifiable patterns with which Jambo Bukoba appears to choose their teachers? Do only those teachers participate whose students grades are already high?

- Which additional data could be useful for answering these questions? Is there data that Jambo Bukoba could collect at a reasonable price? What external data could be used?

## Pie charts schools reached overall
In total 31% have at least one teacher who visited a workshop. 
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
SchoolsWS <- table(SchoolLevel$SUM.WORKSHOPS)
#pie(SchoolsWS)
lbls4 <- paste(names(SchoolsWS), "\n", SchoolsWS, sep="")
pct4 <- round(SchoolsWS/sum(SchoolsWS)*100, 1)
lbls4 <- paste(pct4,"%",sep="") # ad % to labels
pie(SchoolsWS, labels = lbls4, col=rainbow(length(lbls4)),
    main="Sum of Workshops - School Level\n (percentage)") 
legend("topright", c("No Workshop","One Workshop","Two Workshops","Three Workshops"), cex=0.55, fill=rainbow(length(lbls4)))
```

## Average grade of schools 2014
Range from 0 to 250
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
hist(SchoolLevel$Average_Marks_2013, main="Average grade 2014")
```

## Students' grades Englisch
Distribution of 2013 and 2015
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
hist(StudentLevel$english_grade_numeric, main="Grades Englisch")
```

## Gender ratio 1
Proportion of male and female students, 2013 and 2014
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
MaleFemale <- table(StudentLevel$student_sex)
lbls <- c("Female", "Male")
pct <- round(MaleFemale/sum(MaleFemale)*100)
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct)
lbls <- paste(lbls, "%", sep="")
pie(MaleFemale, labels = lbls, col = rainbow(length(lbls)), main="Pie Chart of Gender")
```


## Gender ratio 2
Proportion of male and female students per class 2013/14
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
hist(TimeSeries$Student_sex_mean, main="Percentage of male student")
```

## Warm-up questions
Do you want to familiarize yourself with datasets? Here are simple warm up tasks for you:

1. How many School projects are in the dataset? What were the activities?
2. How many schools have more female than male students?
3. How many students did participate in workshops in 2014?
4. Are grades normally distributed?
5. Are boys better in maths and girls better in Swahili?
